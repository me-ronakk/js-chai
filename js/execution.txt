* javascript execution context steps :-
1) GLOBAL EXECUTION context of our code and allocated in THIS (differ in node and browser)
2)FUNTION EXECUTION context
3)EVAL EXECUTION context

TWO PHASES OF EXECUTION OF OUR CODE :

* MEMORY CREATION PHASE / CREATION PHASE (PLACE IS ALLOCATED IN THIS PHASE)
* EXECUTION PHASE (CODE IS EXECUTED IN THIS PHASE)


ALL THE STEPS:
1) GLOBAL EXECUTION context of our code and allocated in THIS (differ in node and browser)

MEMORY CREATION PHASE :-
2) all variables are collected in memory and kept with undefined
3) in funtion we put the defination of function

EXECUTION PHASE :-
4)values are provied instead of undefined
5)during execution a new varibale enviornment with new execution phase (new box is created)
6)again inside the new box created above follows up the 2 steps of memory phase and execution phase.
once the work of executionis done the new box was created is deleted


*more thn one funtion / having two and three funtion in one funtion process:
1)it uses LIFO (last in first out)method
2)if one named funtion is having  two named funtion inside and two is having three named funtion inside , last one to be executed
will be three so first three wll come out and thn two and lastly one funtion
